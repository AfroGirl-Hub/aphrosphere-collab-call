# ✨ CALLING POC DEVELOPERS, UX ENGINEERS & AI BUILDERS ✨

Hi — I’m working on a *culture-first* platform rooted in **beauty, care, and tech**.

The concept is bold, editorial, and created with melanin-rich experiences at the centre. Design is already in motion. Now I’m looking for **POC developers, UX engineers, and AI/LLM enthusiasts** who want to co-create something meaningful — not just build another app.

## Who I’m Looking For:
- Frontend or full-stack developers  
- UX/UI engineers with a creative, product-focused mindset  
- LLM/AI developers or enthusiasts excited by applied AI in beauty tech  
- Passionate collaborators open to freelance, equity-based, or pro-bono support  
  *(We’re early-stage and self-funded — but we’re building with purpose.)*

## Why This Matters:
Founders like me are often told to “just take out a loan” to build tech.  
But we come from communities where that’s not always an option — and that *shouldn’t stop us from building powerfully*.  
We’re redefining how beauty and care show up in tech, and I’m calling in builders who feel aligned with that mission.

If this resonates, I’d love to connect.

Let’s build something audacious, human-first, and culture-led — together.
